    "Imagine you are in charge of watching a big forest. You want to keep everyone safe, but sometimes wildfires can start without warning. These fires can spread quickly and cause a lot of damage. So, we want to build a computer program that can look at pictures of forests and tell us if there’s a fire starting or not. This program can help people react faster to stop wildfires!"
